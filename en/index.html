					<h3>Red-Legged Wot Wot</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							The Red-Legged Wot Wot is one of the eight species known to live at Gruispan. It is common in sub-tropical areas of South Africa and thrives in a variety of habitats from savanna to wetland areas. The Red-Legged Wot Wot walks, rather than hops and is easily recognised by the bright red colour on the inside of its hind legs.

					<h3>Bubbling Kassina</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							A common frog species found throughout South Africa, The Bubbling Kassina is found in most types of wetland areas, and also around dams and ponds.
							It is distinguished from all other species by its call, an explosive “boip” which can be heard from a great distance.<br/>
							Males start calling far from the water’s edge and once a female has been attracted, they make their way together to the water.<br/>
							Between 100 and 500 eggs are laid in shallow water and stuck to submerged vegetation, rocks and other objects. The tadpoles develop slowly taking 52 to 90 days to complete this part of their life cycle.

					<h3>Painted Reed Frog</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							The Painted Reed Frog is widespread along the east coast of Southern Africa. It is found at the margins of swamps, rivers and lakes in all types of savannah, grassland and bush, as well as many human-modified habitats, including cultivated land, towns and gardens.<br />
							Named for their bright colouration and patterning, there are several colour morphs across the range. Distinguishable by its bright red/pink under-limbs and toes. The toes end in toe pads that enable the frog to climb up stems of grass and reeds.<br />
							During the rainy season, the eggs are laid in water in clumps of about 20, attached to underwater vegetation.

					<h3>Tinker Reed Frog</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							A rather large, bright green reed frog from the eastern lowlands of Africa. It is found in a variety of bushveld habitats and breeds in the reed beds on the edges of swamps and pans. <br />
							The eggs are enclosed in a gelatinous cake which is attached to reed or grass stems just above the waterline. The tadpoles are brown with golden and bronze spots on the light underside. They drop into the water as they hatch.

					<h3>Water Lily Frog</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							Water lilies are important for this little frog! It is tiny and almost translucent. It breeds in shallow pans, ponds, vleis and dams where water lilies grow. Breeding takes place from October to March when males form dense choruses on floating vegetation. There can be high levels of aggression between males as they butt one another with their vocal sacs. <br />
							About 500 light green eggs are laid in groups of 20 -120, in a single layer between the overlapping margins of the lily leaves. Jelly surrounding the eggs. This acts as a glue to keep the leaves together.

					<h3>Dwarf Puddle Frog</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							The Dwarf Puddle Frog is found in the lowlands and up to a maximum altitude of 1,500m. Its small size and characteristic insect-like call makes it easy to identify.
							<br />These frogs are very common and play a significant role in the ecology of their wetland habitat. They begin breeding immediately after the first spring rains. Eggs are laid in a single flat layer about 5cm in diameter that floats on the water. Metamorphosis is completed after about five weeks, at which stage the juvenile froglets are only 6mm long.

					<h3>Southern Foam Nest Frog</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							This frog’s rough, dry skin is adapted to arid environments. When basking in an exposed position, they become chalky white or pale grey thus reflecting heat and light.<br />
							The female leaves the water and finds a suitable nesting site on a branch, or reed overhanging the water. She secretes a substance which she churns with her back legs to create a foam. A number of males join her to fertilize the eggs she lays in this sac. The eggs hatch within the nest. After 4–6 days, the wriggling tadpoles begin to move downward until they reach the bottom, break through the crust and fall into the water.

					<h3>Raucous Toad</h3>
					<div class="languages">
						<p>
							This is a robust medium to large-sized toad reaching approximately 120mm in length. The skin is liberally sprinkled with wart-like protuberances (glands). In the breeding season, males make a loud repetitive duck-like quacking. Like most toads, it has a gland behind each eye which will exude whitish spots of venom. This can be hazardous to predators.  Raucous toads are prolific breeders and can lay up to 10,000 eggs in a spiralling string which becomes entangled in vegetation.
